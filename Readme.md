Startpage
=========

When opening my web browser, I want to be inspired by great artists. I wrote _startpage_ for this.
Startpage queries [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) frequently and renders a random landscape image into a fullscreen
HTML page. I installed this page as my startpage in my web browser.

Configuration
-------------

The Unsplash API key has to live in the environment variable `STARTPAGE_API_KEY`. You can request it free of charge
at [Unsplash developers](https://unsplash.com/developers).
